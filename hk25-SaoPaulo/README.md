Suggested topics over South America using high-resolution climate simulations:

- **Simulation Verification:** Application of Statistical Metrics
  
- **Model Performance in Complex Regions**: Assess simulation results in areas where models typically struggle. Example regions: Andes, Eastern Amazon.

- **Seasonality Analysis**: Define boxes in selected regions to assess the seasonality of key variables. Since the focus is on high resolution, consider regionalizing areas such as metropolitan regions.

- **Diurnal Cycle**: Use regional or sub-regional boxes (e.g., from IPCC regions) to analyze the diurnal cycle of variables.

- **EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) for climate modes**: Not applicable, as only one year of data is available.

- **Monsoon Analysis**: Plot precipitation vs. month in the monsoon region to evaluate seasonal patterns.

- **SACZ (South Atlantic Convergence Zone)**: Create seasonal climatology to assess average position and intensity. Not enough data for climatology.

- **Simulation Comparisons**: Compare different simulations, models, and physical parameterizations.

- **Case Studies**: Analyze specific events such as cyclones, MCSs, etc. See GrEC`s table.

- **Extremes Analysis**: Investigate precipitation and temperature extremes.
