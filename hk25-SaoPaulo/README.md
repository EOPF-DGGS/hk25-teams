# São Paulo Node: research topics (hk25-SaoPaulo):

The São Paulo node has proposed ten key research topics, focusing on significant atmospheric phenomena in South America. Our primary goal is to utilize high-resolution climate simulations to investigate and gain a deeper understanding of these critical areas. We aim to analyze global climate models through a regional lens, concentrating specifically on our continent. This approach will leverage existing tools, methodologies, and datasets to gain valuable insights.

### Acessing data in São Paulo Node:
Across the nodes there are several simulations available according to the catalog (https://digital-earths-global-hackathon.github.io/catalog/catalog.yaml). 

São Paulo node is storing the '```glm.n2560_RAL3p3```' simulation from the UK MetOffice at IAG/USP server (Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas da USP). This covers the DYAMOND-3 period (Jan 2020-Feb 2021). 

```glm.n2560_RAL3p3``` uses the N2560 global grid (~5 km in mid-latitudes) explicit convection globally (no active convection parameterisation) and regional atmosphere-land configuration (RAL3p3; Bush et al., 2023; 2025). 


In this server you will also find observational datasets as described in [tp_datasets.md](https://github.com/salvatirehbein/hk25-teams/blob/main/hk25-SaoPaulo/tp_datasets.md). Please search for the README file in each folder to find a description of the datasets.
